payments by means of a smartphone application and was published on May 7, 2013, after Danske Bank discontinued its cooperation with other Danish banks on a common solution.", "It is mainly used in Denmark, but also in Finland.", "MobilePay was also available in Norway, but shut down in January 2018 due to competition from Vipps.", "MobilePay is a member of the European Mobile Payment Systems Association.", "MobilePay is an application for phones with operating systems iOS and Android.", "By downloading this application, users are required to connect a credit card and account information to their mobile number.", "Money transfers are performed by entering a mobile phone number which is registered in the system.", "The funds are then transferred to this account, while the amount is deducted from the sender's credit card.", "There are no fees for private MobilePay accounts.", "The application is protected by a user-selected four-digit PIN code or a fingerprint.", "[1] The login id is either the CPR-number (national id number), or the NemID, a more secure solution.", "[2]\n Users must have an Android or iPhone smartphone with a Danish phone number, a Danish CPR-number, a Danish bank account with a card, and be at least 13 years old.", "[3] Private people can only have one MobilePay account.", "Companies and people doing business can have a business account, which has fees (around DKK 0.30-0.80 per transaction).", "Payment via mobile phones first became popular in Denmark, when DSB and the other traffic operators in the Copenhagen metropolitan area launched ticketing via SMS in January 2009, which worked as an extension of a similar system in Funen.", "[4][full citation needed]\n In 2012, the Danish banks started a project with the aim of developing a joint solution.", "[5] Danske Bank choose to discontinue the cooperation at the end of 2012, quoting among other reasons that the joint system would not be usable outside of Denmark.", "[5]\n On May 7, 2013, Danske Bank launched MobilePay, which by the end of 2013 had been installed 877.000 times.", "[6] The cooperation between the other banks was named Swipp (now defunct) [7], and was launched on June 13, 2013.", "[8]\n Originally Danske Bank intended to offer MobilePay free of charge until the end of 2013, but then decided to let the system remain free of charge for private users even after this date.", "[8][9]\n MobilePay is also offered in Finland.", "In August 2015 MobilePay was marketed in Norway.", "[10] It has been downloaded over 300.000 times but the main competitor in Norway Vipps is much more used.", "On January 11, 2018 MobilePay discontinued all services in Norway including online payment, in app payment, in store payment and payment to other users.", "This was largely due to most of Norway's other banks all backing Vipps.", "[11]"], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment": ["Mobile payment (also referred to as mobile money, mobile money transfer, and mobile wallet) generally refer to payment services operated under financial regulation and performed from or via a mobile device.", "Instead of paying with cash, cheque, or credit cards, a consumer can use a mobile to pay for a wide range of services and digital or hard goods.", "Although the concept of using non-coin-based currency systems has a long history,[1] it is only in the 21st century that the technology to support such systems has become widely available.", "Mobile payment is being adopted all over the world in different ways.", "[2][3] The first patent exclusively defined \"Mobile Payment System\" was filed in 2000[4].", "In developing countries mobile payment solutions have been deployed as a means of extending financial services to the community known as the \"unbanked\" or \"underbanked\", which is estimated to be as much as 50% of the world's adult population, according to Financial Access' 2009 Report \"Half the World is Unbanked\".", "[5] These payment networks are often used for micropayments.", "[6] The use of mobile payments in developing countries has attracted public and private funding by organizations such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, United States Agency for International Development and Mercy Corps.", "Mobile payments are becoming a key instrument for PSPs and other market participants, in order to achieve new growth opportunities, according to the European Payments Council (EPC).", "[7] The EPC states that \"new technology solutions provide a direct improvement to the operations efficiency, ultimately resulting in cost savings and in an increase in business volume\".", "There are five primary models for mobile payments:[8][citation needed]\n There can be combinations: \n Financial institutions and credit card companies[10] as well as Internet companies such as Google[11] and a number of mobile communication companies, such as mobile network operators and major telecommunications infrastructure such as w-HA from Orange and smartphone multinationals such as Ericsson[12][13] and BlackBerry have implemented mobile payment solutions.", "A mobile wallet is an app that contain your debit and credit card information so that users can pay for goods and services digitally by using their mobile devices.", "[14] Notable mobile wallets include:\n Generally, this is the process:[citation needed]\n First payment:\n Subsequent payments:\n Requesting a PIN is known to lower the success rate (conversion) for payments.", "These systems can be integrated with directly or can be combined with operator and credit card payments through a unified mobile web payment platform.", "A simple mobile web payment system can also include a credit card payment flow allowing a consumer to enter their card details to make purchases.", "This process is familiar but any entry of details on a mobile phone is known to reduce the success rate (conversion) of payments.", "In addition, if the payment vendor can automatically and securely identify customers then card details can be recalled for future purchases turning credit card payments into simple single click-to-buy giving higher conversion rates for additional purchases.", "The consumer uses the mobile billing option during checkout at an e-commerce site\u2014such as an online gaming site\u2014to make a payment.", "After two-factor authentication involving the consumer's mobile number and a PIN or One-Time-Password (often abbreviated as OTP), the consumer's mobile account is charged for the purchase.", "It is a true alternative payment method that does not require the use of credit/debit cards or pre-registration at an online payment solution such as PayPal, thus bypassing banks and credit card companies altogether.", "This type of mobile payment method, which is prevalent in Asia,[citation needed] provides the following benefits: \n In the predominant model for SMS payments, the consumer sends a payment request via an SMS text message or an USSD to a short code and a premium charge is applied to their phone bill or their online wallet.", "The merchant involved is informed of the payment success and can then release the paid for goods.", "[17]\n Since a trusted physical delivery address has typically not been given, these goods are most frequently digital with the merchant replying using a Multimedia Messaging Service to deliver the purchased music, ringtones, wallpapers etc.", "A Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) can also deliver barcodes which can then be scanned for confirmation of payment by a merchant.", "This is used as an electronic ticket for access to cinemas and events or to collect hard goods.", "Transactional payments by SMS have been popular in Asia and Europe and are now accompanied by other mobile payment methods,[citation needed] such as mobile web payments (WAP), mobile payment client (Java ME, Android...) and Direct Mobile Billing.", "Inhibiting factors of Premium SMS include:[citation needed]\n Even as the volume of Premium SMS transactions have flattened, many cloud-based payment systems continue to use SMS for presentment, authorization, and authentication,[18] while the payment itself is processed through existing payment networks such as credit and debit card networks.", "These solutions combine the ubiquity of the SMS channel,[19] with the security and reliability of existing payment infrastructure.", "Since SMS lacks end-to-end encryption, such solutions employ a higher-level security strategies known as 'tokenization' and 'target removal' [20] whereby payment occurs without transmitting any sensitive account details, username, password, or PIN.", "To date, point-of-sales mobile payment solutions have not relied on SMS-based authentication as a payment mechanism, but remote payments such as bill payments,[21] seat upgrades on flights,[22] and membership or subscription renewals are commonplace.", "In comparison to premium short code programs which often exist in isolation, relationship marketing and payment systems are often integrated with CRM, ERP, marketing-automation platforms, and reservation systems.", "Many of the problems inherent with premium SMS have been addressed by solution providers.", "Remembering keywords is not required since sessions are initiated by the enterprise to establish a transaction specific context.", "Reply messages are linked to the proper session and authenticated either synchronously through a very short expiry period  (every reply is assumed to be to the last message sent) or by tracking session according to varying reply addresses and/or reply options.", "[23]\n The consumer uses web pages displayed or additional applications downloaded and installed on the mobile phone to make a payment.", "It uses WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) as underlying technology and thus inherits all the advantages and disadvantages of WAP.", "Benefits include:[24][citation needed]\n However, unless the mobile account is directly charged through a mobile network operator, the use of a credit/debit card or pre-registration at online payment solution such as PayPal is still required just as in a desktop environment.", "Mobile web payment methods are now being mandated by a number of mobile network operators.", "Direct operator billing, also known as mobile content billing, WAP billing, and carrier billing, \nrequires integration with the mobile network operator.", "It provides certain benefits:\n One of the drawbacks is that the payout rate will often be much lower than with other mobile payments options.", "Examples from a popular provider:\n More recently, Direct operator billing is being deployed in an in-app environment, where mobile application developers are taking advantage of the one-click payment option that Direct operator billing provides for monetising mobile applications.", "This is a logical alternative to credit card and Premium SMS billing.", "In 2012, Ericsson and Western Union partnered to expand the direct operator billing market, making it possible for mobile operators to include Western Union Mobile Money Transfers as part of their mobile financial service offerings.", "[26] Given the international reach of both companies, the partnership is meant to accelerate the interconnection between the m-commerce market and the existing financial world.", "[27]\n Near-field communication (NFC) is used mostly in paying for purchases made in physical stores or transportation services.", "A consumer using a special mobile phone equipped with a smartcard waves his/her phone near a reader module.", "Most transactions do not require authentication, but some require authentication using PIN, before transaction is completed.", "The payment could be deducted from a pre-paid account or charged to a mobile or bank account directly.", "Mobile payment method via NFC faces significant challenges for wide and fast adoption, due to lack of supporting infrastructure, complex ecosystem of stakeholders, and standards.", "[28] Some phone manufacturers and banks, however, are enthusiastic.", "Ericsson and Aconite are examples of businesses that make it possible for banks to create consumer mobile payment applications that take advantage of NFC technology.", "[29]\n NFC vendors in Japan are closely related to mass-transit networks, like the Mobile Suica used on the JR East rail network.", "Osaifu-Keitai system, used for Mobile Suica and many others including Edy and nanaco, has become the de facto standard method for mobile payments in Japan.", "Its core technology, Mobile FeliCa IC, is partially owned by Sony, NTT DoCoMo and JR East.", "Mobile FeliCa utilize Sony's FeliCa technology, which itself is the de facto standard for contactless smart cards in the country.", "Other NFC vendors mostly in Europe use contactless payment over mobile phones to pay for on- and off-street parking in specially demarcated areas.", "Parking wardens may enforce the parkings by license plate, transponder tags or barcode stickers.", "First conceptualized in the 1990s,[citation needed] the technology has seen commercial use in this century in both Scandinavia and Estonia.", "End users benefit from the convenience of being able to pay for parking from the comfort of their car with their mobile phone, and parking operators are not obliged to invest in either existing or new street-based parking infrastructures.", "Parking wardens maintain order in these systems by license plate, transponder tags or barcode stickers or they read a digital display in the same way as they read a pay and display receipt.", "Other vendors use a combination of both NFC and a barcode on the mobile device for mobile payment, because many mobile devices in the market do not yet support NFC.", "[30]\n QR Codes 2D barcode are square bar codes.", "QR codes have been in use since 1994.", "[31] Originally used to track products in warehouses, QR codes were designed to replace traditional (1D bar codes).", "Traditional bar codes just represent numbers, which can be looked up in a database and translated into something meaningful.", "QR, or \u201cQuick Response\u201d bar codes were designed to contain the meaningful info right in the bar code.", "QR Codes can be of two main categories:[32][citation needed]\n Mobile self-checkout allows for one to scan a QR code or barcode of a product inside a brick-and-mortar establishment in order to purchase the product on the spot.", "This theoretically eliminates or reduces the incidence of long checkout lines, even at self-checkout kiosks.", "Google, PayPal, GlobalPay and GoPago use a cloud-based approach to in-store mobile payment.", "The cloud based approach places the mobile payment provider in the middle of the transaction, which involves two separate steps.", "First, a cloud-linked payment method is selected and payment is authorized via NFC or an alternative method.", "During this step, the payment provider automatically covers the cost of the purchase with issuer linked funds.", "Second, in a separate transaction, the payment provider charges the purchaser's selected, cloud-linked account in a card-not-present environment to recoup its losses on the first transaction.", "[33][34][35]\n The audio channel of the mobile phone is another wireless interface that is used to make payments.", "Several companies have created technology to use the acoustic features of cell phones to support mobile payments and other applications that are not chip-based.", "The technologies Near sound data transfer (NSDT), Data Over Voice and NFC 2.0 produce audio signatures that the microphone of the cell phone can pick up to enable electronic transactions.", "[36]\n In the T-Cash[37] model, the mobile phone and the phone carrier is the front-end interface to the consumers.", "The consumer can purchase goods, transfer money to a peer, cash out, and cash in.", "[38] A 'mini wallet' account can be opened as simply as entering *700# on the mobile phone,[39] presumably by depositing money at a participating local merchant and the mobile phone number.", "Presumably, other transactions are similarly accomplished by entering special codes and the phone number of the other party on the consumer's mobile phone.", "Swish is the name of a system established in Sweden.", "[40] It was established through a collaboration from major banks in 2012 and has been very successful, with 66 percent of the population as users in 2017.", "[41]  It is mainly used for peer-to-peer payments between private people, but is also used by church collect, street vendors and small businesses.", "A person's account is tied to his or her phone number and the connection between the phone number and the actual bank account number is registered in the internet bank.", "The electronic identification system mobile BankID, issued by several Swedish banks, is used to verify the payment.", "Users with a simple phone or without the app can still receive money if the phone number is registered in the internet bank.", "Like many other mobile payment system, its main obstacle is getting people to register and download the app, but it has managed to reach a critical mass and it has become part of everyday life for many Swedes.", "Swedish payments company Trustly also enables mobile bank transfers, but is used mainly for business-to-consumer transactions that occur solely online.", "If an e-tailer integrates with Trustly, its customers can pay directly from their bank account.", "As opposed to Swish, users don't need to register a Trustly account or download software to pay with it.", "The Danish MobilePay and Norwegian Vipps are also popular in their countries.", "They use direct and instant bank transfers, but also for users not connected to a participating bank, credit card billing.", "In India, a new direct bank transfer system
